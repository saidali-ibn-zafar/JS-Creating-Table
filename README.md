# JS-Creating-Table
The project consists of a function that takes an array of user objects as input and returns the oldest user based on their age. The user's name, age, and profession are then displayed in an HTML table using dynamically created &lt;table>, &lt;tr>, and &lt;td> elements in JavaScript.
